# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! This repository contains various training projects and parts of projects that I am working on as I develop my skills as a Junior Data Scientist.

## Project Structure

Here is a breakdown of the main directories in this repository:

- **PREDICTEDGRADES**: A project focused on predicting grades based on specific input features. This project is an exercise in regression analysis and model evaluation.
  
- **01HousingData**: A project that explores housing data, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building. This dataset is used to predict house prices based on various factors like income, location, and more.

- **references**: Contains resources and documentation that support the various machine learning projects and concepts being applied.

## About the Projects

Each folder contains different stages of training on machine learning techniques, from data preprocessing to building machine learning models. These projects aim to enhance my understanding of machine learning algorithms and data analysis processes. 

Feel free to explore each project and learn how different machine learning techniques are applied to real-world data!
